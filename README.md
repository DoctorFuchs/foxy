## ATTENTION: This is not a safe system! We are using pickle to safe our databases. But if you want to help us you can make it safe :)

First of all, if you need more help you can go to [/docs](https://github.com/DoctorFuchs/foxy/blob/master/docs/README.md) and read more READMEs. 

> ## What is foxy?
> Foxy is a system for easy and fast databases. I want to make databases easy for python beginners (and everybody else too). So they have all a way to create databases without using sql.
> In my vision of future, beginners need a easy and comfortable way into databases, python and other languages. 
> ### SO LET US CREATE A SAFE AND EASY DATABASE SYSTEM 

## install 

Maybe, i will do a PyPi package in a few weeks

```commandline
